## ClamAV Installation and Configuration (Windows)

1. **Download ClamAV**
   - Download the latest ClamAV for Windows (ZIP version) from the [official website](https://www.clamav.net/downloads).
   - Unzip it to a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\ClamAV`).

2. **Prepare configuration files**
   - Inside the `conf_examples` folder, locate:
     - `clamd.conf.sample`
     - `freshclam.conf.sample`
   - Move both files to the main ClamAV folder (e.g., `C:\ClamAV`).
   - Remove the `.sample` extension from both file names.
   - Open each file and delete the word `Example` in any configuration lines where it appears.

3. **Update the virus database**
   - Open **Command Prompt**.
   - Navigate to the ClamAV folder:
     ```bash
     cd C:\ClamAV
     ```
   - Run:
     ```bash
     freshclam.exe
     ```
     This will download the latest virus definition database.

4. **Test scanning**
   - In Command Prompt:
     ```bash
     clamscan.exe "path\to\your\file.txt"
     ```
   - If ClamAV is working, it will display the scan result.
